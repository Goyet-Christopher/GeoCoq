# Forked from GeoCoq
A formalization of geometry in Coq by Goyet Christopher

This library contains a formalization of geometry using the Coq proof assistant. It contains both proofs about the foundations of geometry and high-level proofs in the same style as in high-school.

Trying to make a more usable version of Geocoq, with :
- as little tactics as possible,
- explicits and readable proofs,
- smalls files / sort lemmas by similarity,
- changing the names of many lemmas to make them more understandable and recognizable,
- as many lemmas as possible (to simplify the use for everyone, 
without having to know the whole library by heart ... )
