# Forked from GeoCoq
A forked formalization of geometry in Coq by Goyet Christopher

Trying to make a more usable version of Geocoq in practice, with :
- as little tactics as possible,
- explicits and readable proofs (especially without auto tactics),
- faster compilation (another reason to avoid auto tactics),
- shorter files and sorting lemmas by same utility/similarity/goal/aim, 
- changing the names of lemmas to make them more understandable and recognizable,
- as many lemmas as possible, to simplify the use for everyone, 
without having to know the whole library by heart ...

# master branch : GeoCoq

This library contains a formalization of geometry using the Coq proof assistant. It contains both proofs about the foundations of geometry and high-level proofs in the same style as in high-school.
