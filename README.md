# Forked from GeoCoq
A formalization of geometry in Coq by Goyet Christopher

This library contains a formalization of geometry using the Coq proof assistant. It contains both proofs about the foundations of geometry and high-level proofs in the same style as in high-school.

Trying to make a more usable version of Geocoq, with :
- as little tactics as possible,
- explicits and readable proofs
- small files, lemmas sorted by similarity
- as many lemmas as possible (to simplify use for everyone, 
without having to memorize the entire library ... )
